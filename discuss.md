Hi! Benjamin.

Hope you're doing well. 


Can I contribute to this project?

Can you please share your idea?

If I go with react app for web version or react-native for android version, will it be ok? 

Whatever it be, the main code is same and js based. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best wishes.
